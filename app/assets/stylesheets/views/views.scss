// NOTE: Views are styles specific to an individual view. Use of these styles should be avoided as much as possible. Base styles, elements, and components should be used as much as possible. You would add a view style if a view needed a customer or overriding implementation. However, if you find yourself in this situation, talk with a designer and see if it could be redesigned to use a standard styling.
